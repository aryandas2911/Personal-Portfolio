# 🧠 Personal Portfolio — React + Framer Motion

A modern, interactive developer portfolio built with **React** and **Framer Motion**, featuring scroll-based animations, a sticky progress bar, and a clean, responsive layout. This project showcases my key development projects in a visually engaging way, with smooth animations and a modular code structure.

## ✨ Features

- ⚡ Scroll-based parallax animations using `framer-motion`
- 🧠 Project cards with dynamic image/text transitions
- 📊 Sticky scroll progress indicator
- 💅 Fully responsive layout (CSS/SASS-based)
- 💼 Optimized for showcasing multiple projects
- 📁 Easily extensible for new projects or sections

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components, Hooks)
- **Framer Motion** (`useScroll`, `useTransform`, `motion.div`)
- **SASS / SCSS** for modular styling
- **Vite / CRA** *(depending on your setup)*
